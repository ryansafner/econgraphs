# econgraphs

For my [courses](https://ryansafner.com/#teaching), I have produced dozens of variants of economics-related graphs using `ggplot2`, as I write all of my slides in `R markdown` and `Xaringan` presentations. 

This repository is an attempt to collect them all and sort them by category, to find easier ways to streamline the process (as I often do it manually for each graph) and write simplifying functions, and eventually, perhaps release as a package.
